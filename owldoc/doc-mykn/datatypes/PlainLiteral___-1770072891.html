I then moved the model to BiZZdesign .. but boy oh boy, was that GUI and UX a hot mess. Would rather have stayed on Archi but the client wanted it.  :-[   Beugh.<br />I now use Archi in AstraZeneca and am an ambassador there .. fighting off BiZZdesign, Lean.IX and (guess what) Microsoft Access. We will move to a SaaS platform one day I'm sure, but Archi gets us value very very quickly."</span>&nbsp;</li>

I've been really pleased with the tools for publishing in different formats, to make it easier for non-architects to read documentation."</span>&nbsp;</li>

In active development for almost three decades, Octave runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac—and is packaged for most major distributions. If you're looking for a project that is as close to the actual MATLAB language as possible, Octave may be a good fit for you; it strives for exact compatibility, so many of your projects developed for MATLAB may run in Octave with no modification necessary.<br /><br />Octave has many different choices available for a front-end interaction outside of the default that now ships with version 4; some resemble MATLAB's interface more than others. Octave's Wikipedia page lists several options.<br /><br />Octave is licensed under the GPL, and its source code can be found on the GNU download site (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave)."</span>&nbsp;</li>

It can process N-dimensional arrays, complex matrix transforms, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and can act as a gateway for C and C++ integration. It's been used in the world of game and film visual effect development, and is the fundamental data-array structure for the SciPy Stack, an ecosystem of Python-based math, science, and engineering software.

It has many features including a command-line interface, browser-based notebooks, tools for embedding formulas in other documents, and of course, many mathematical libraries.<br /><br />SageMath is available under a GPL license, and its source code can be found on the project website (http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html)."</span>&nbsp;</li>
