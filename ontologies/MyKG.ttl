If you're looking for a project that is as close to the actual MATLAB language as possible, Octave may be a good fit for you; it strives for exact compatibility, so many of your projects developed for MATLAB may run in Octave with no modification necessary.Octave has many different choices available for a front-end interaction outside of the default that now ships with version 4; some resemble MATLAB's interface more than others. Octave's Wikipedia page lists several options.Octave is licensed under the GPL, and its source code can be found on the GNU download site (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave)."^^xsd:string .

It's designed to feel like a scripting language rather than a C-style programming-language and even has an interactive mode (REPL), and can be embedded into other languages through its embedding API.Users of Julia have many reasons for loving its syntax and capabilities, but some of the popular examples include its broadcasting feature, which lets you apply a function to one or more arrays without a writing a complex loop, its simple array functions that let you rotate and reshape arrays, matrix transforms, autodiff, native Unicode support, integrated unit testing, easy paralellisation, and all-round simpler syntax with no loss of functionality (and improved code efficiency.)Julia has an active community around its development and its use, so it's also been tailored for domain-specific purposes, including image processing (JuliaImages), biology (BioJulia), quantum physics (QuantumBFS), nonlinear dynamics (JuliaDynamics), economics (QuantEcon), astronomy (JuliaAstro) and more.Julia is licensed under the MIT license, and can be downloaded from julialang.org.:XSD_ANY_URI"^^xsd:string .

Since theyhad no \"official\" tool in place I also introduced them to Archi (http://www.archimatetool.com, an open sourceimplementation of ArchiMate) as a means to learn the language and start on the development of some BusinessArchitecture models. Archi is very easy to install and much quicker to learn than most of the commercial tools(e.g. Sparx EA) I have worked with. It also had \"just enough\" functionality to support our modelling needs at thetime. Archi's CSV import/export functionality allowed us to quickly import model content from external sources aswell as utilize an export-update-import approach to manage bulk updates to the model. Its support for the OpenGroup’s ArchiMate Model Exchange File format further guarantees the portability of model files and mitigates therisk of vendor lock-in. Its sole limitation is that it does not support external image files in a diagram.The key deliverables for the project included a Business Capability Map which was developed as a hierarchical,nested diagram based on a set of ArchiMate \"business function\" elements. Since ArchiMate 2.1 does not includea \"capability\" element, we followed the prevailing practise of using the \"business function\" element for thispurpose. We also used the Jasper Reports module included with Archi to generate a supporting BusinessCapability Reference document which contained the capability descriptions, as well as other supportinginformation.New Brunswick is officially bilingual (English/French) so we were required to publish these deliverables in bothofficial languages. Please refer to the following links to view the resulting deliverables – the Business CapabilityMap and Reference Model are accessible via the “Quick Links” section on each page:www.gnb.ca/OCIO English Capability Map English Capability Referencewww.gnb.ca/BCSI French Capability Map French Capability ReferenceNote: The following techniques were used to produce these artifacts. Capability Map was created as an ArchiMate view and then the diagram was exported as a PDF file. Pages that include graphics were created using blank Business Canvas pages. The Provincial logo was added to the PDF using the open-source Inkscape graphics editor(https://inkscape.org). The Reference document was 100% generated from Archi using a customized set of Jasper control files. The Jasper report was generated in MS Word format in order to fine tune page breaks and add headersand footers. User-defined properties for \"French:name\" and \"French:documentation\".were added to the French versions. The model was exported to CSV files, using some Excel tricks to swap the French and English values, andre-imported to Archi before repeating the above steps."^^xsd:string .

Their licensing and implementation costs are very high and usually do not end up convincing the sponsors about the return on investment.My recommendation: The focus of the architecture practice should be on the value it generates within the industry where it will be applied. Going to have a well governed repository, which allows to respond things of value to the business easily and within the reach of those interested. So that it allows them to advance to a new business result.We evaluated Archi vs. The Essential Project and my recommendation was Archi, among the reasons is the noise generated by adding ontological themes to modeling. Being that our framework is based on TOGAF and this speaks in terms of Archimate. My recommendation was Archi.What would we like to be incorporated in Archi?Multi-user and collaborative facility. Which is in progress.Extend the tool so that it covers the entire TOGAF architecture repository structure and the artifacts link to the model.Incorporate a graph database to facilitate impact analysis at a greater depth level.In my case we are doing a work to define/create the meta architecture (Phase A) that will start by modeling BIAN Landscape v6.0 (Phase A, B and C), Hybrid Cloud and dockerization (Phase D), DevOps (We are working on how).Best regards,José Alfredo Guillénhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-guillen-12160085"^^xsd:string .

We have implemented a standard \"EA\" model which we manage change in Github using Co-archi plugin functionality.  We have integrated it with our EAMS and import content from the EAMS into the model in order to make it available to use in our views.-Kevin"^^xsd:string .

  rdfs:comment "AdGerrits (2018-05-08):Although we have been working with Archi for some time within the municipality of Nijmegen (the Netherlands), it is from today the standard architecture-tool that we use. The lack of collaboration functionality used to be a showstopper, but it is now present in sufficient quantities and hopefully will be even better in the future. I really think that Archi is in many cases more usable than other closed and expensive applications. Go go Archi!"^^xsd:string, "https://en.intonijmegen.com/:XSD_ANY_URI"^^xsd:string .

  rdfs:comment "Guido Janssen (2016-06-27):I am working as a architect at PharmaPartners, a dutch IT company creating software for pharmacies and doctor's. I used Archi for a few years already first just as an architecture diagram drawing tool. Recently I used it to set up an IT landscape model. Since I wanted to share the model with different stakeholder I created a reporting website using XSLT based on the Open Exchange format. I have started to share the more generic parts in a Github project (archimateviewer) especially the views using SVGs. This would actually allows for dynamic views based on properties or as the previous post was washing for replacing the visualisation of certain elements by simply drawing a different kind of node in the view."^^xsd:string, "https://www.pharmapartners.nl/:XSD_ANY_URI"^^xsd:string .

The alpha relase will be available on Github soon.Best regards"^^xsd:string, "https://musketeers.group/:XSD_ANY_URI"^^xsd:string .

I also use it to make specific project views on the landscape, depicting changes. It really helps that integrity of relations is kept at all times, to decide in what views to show these or not.Regards,Marco"^^xsd:string, "www.walraven.com:XSD_ANY_URI"^^xsd:string .
